# Particle System in OpenGL

This is a particle system implementation using OpenGL in C.

Run ParticleSystem.exe (use freeglut.dll file found in repo if needed).

Click on screen to launch particles in random directions.

Edit air and gravity parameters in main function to affect particle behaviour. (This functionality is not included in executable file - you will need to produce a new one).
